# Contributor's Guide

You can contribute in many ways: openning or participating of a issue, reporting a bug, sending a [pull request](#submitting-a-pull-request).

## Getting Started
1.  Fork the project on Github, [Help Guide to Fork a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
2.  Clone the project.
3.  Create a branch specific to the issue you are working on.
    ```sh
    git checkout -b update-readme-file
    ```

4.  Open up the project in your favourite text editor, select the file you want to contribute to and make your changes. We recommend [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because this project has some integrations already setuped.

5.  After making your changes in the new git branch then add your modified files to git, [How to add, commit, push and go](http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2/)

    ```sh
    git add path/to/filename.ext
    ```

    You can also add all unstaged files using:
    ```sh
    git add .
    ```

    Note, using a `git add .` will automatically add all files. You can do a `git status` to see your changes, but do it before `git add`.

6.  Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

    ```sh
    git commit -m "Brief Description of Commit"
    ```
7.  Push your commits to your Github Fork:

    ```sh
    git push -u origin branch-name
    ```
8.  Submit a pull request.
